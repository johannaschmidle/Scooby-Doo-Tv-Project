## Motivation
Thanks to a CD I got from a cereal box, I watched the TV show "Scooby Doo Where Are You?" on repeat for years. And it is still one of my comfort shows to this day. I was excited to combine nostalgia with my love of data analysis for this project. I have created a dynamic dashboard that allows users to analyze episode popularity and IMDB scores. Users can explore insights into different networks, series titles, monsters, settings, time frames, and guest stars using filters.

## Task List
1. General data cleaning in SQL
2. Create an interactive dashboard

## Questions You Can Explore Using Dashboard
- Which guest stars do the audience enjoy seeing the most?
- What episode settings do the audience enjoy the most? (Are certain locations and terrains exciting to viewers?)
- What kind of monsters does the audience love to see?
- Which networks were the most popular?
- What was the most popular Scooby Doo show?
- What were each of the networks most popular monsters?
- What are the most popular Scooby Doo episodes ever? Or for each specific network?
